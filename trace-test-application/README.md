trace-test-application
=================

## Purpose

This module is added to enable the testing of the 'trace-gradle-plugin' and the 'trace-sdk' on an 
Android application. This is not required for the public release.

## How to use the Trace Runtime SDK in an Android Studio Project

Currently 'trace-gradle-plugin' and 'trace-sdk' is built and published in the local maven 
repository, so you have to add 'mavenLocal()' to your 'build.gradle' files, as it is written in 
their module in the README files. Be sure to publish those before trying to build this application.
